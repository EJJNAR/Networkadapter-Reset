# Networkadapter-Reset
I made this a a fast way of resetting my laptops network adapter, as it would give me network issues as soon as i connected to a new network.

It simply tests if there is an active internet connection, and in not runs a few lines in cmd to reset the network connection, and finally it disables and re-enables the adapter.
